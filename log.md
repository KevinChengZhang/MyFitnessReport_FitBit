- Decided to have a way to keep track of the progress
- Have been on and off on this project because of Summer classes 
- Noticed that most of the functions are breaking!!
- To-Do: 
- 1. Break up the functions and make helper methods 
    (WHY DID I NOT DO THIS BEFORE)
- 2. Fix intraday_heart_range
- 3. Fix resting_hr
