# My Fitness Report 

### About the Project
------
This is my personal project! I wanted to collect my own data that my Fitbit has collected over the past few years. I also wanted to use this project to implement what I learned in a recent class I took. 

I want to see what relationships there are between specific features and whether or not it has a positive/negative impact on my overall health. 


### To-Do's
##### updated: 04/11/20
* Fix implementation of graphs
* Have the data be stored in a database  (Redis? Mongo? SQL?)


### Sources
------
If I were to source every site I used to figure out what I was doing then there would be no end to this list. So, I'll list the websites I used that I explicitly took someone's code from. 

* This is the site I mainly used to help me start the project. https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/02/using-fitbit-web-api-python.html
